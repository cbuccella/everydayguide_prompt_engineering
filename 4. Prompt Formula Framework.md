# 🌟 The Learn Prompting Method: Formulas for Success

Sometimes the best way to remember something is with an analogy. Let's take a look at some that you can use when you're organize your prompts.

## Before you begin: 

💡 Pro Tip: When setting the role of the AI, avoid using phrases like "Act as" or "Pretend to be." Instead, directly state what the AI is. For example, use "You are an experienced financial advisor" rather than "Act as a financial advisor." This approach helps create a more authentic and focused response from the AI, as it's not being asked to pretend or act, but to embody the role directly.
